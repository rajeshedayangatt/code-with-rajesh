## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React-based framework that offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and many built-in optimizations for building high-performance web applications.

    <thead>
      <tr>

      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Hybrid Rendering with Three.js Integration</td>
        <td>
          Next.js allows you to use server-side rendering (SSR) or static site
          generation (SSG) alongside Three.js for delivering optimized 3D
          content. You can render components initially on the server for faster
          page loads, while complex Three.js animations or models can be handled
          client-side, ensuring that 3D applications remain performant and
          SEO-friendly.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dynamic Routing and API Endpoints for 3D Content</td>
        <td>
          Using API routes in Next.js, you can manage dynamic content for 3D
          Specific 3D assets, textures, or models such as loading
          Configurations based on user interactions or queries. This enables
          Creating dynamic 3D visuals in Three.js that can respond to the user
          Input allows for customizable or interactive 3D experiences (eg.
          A 3D configurator or visualization tool).

## What is Three.js?

Three.js is a JavaScript 3D library that makes WebGL easier to use. It allows developers to create 3D graphics in a web browser without the need for extensive WebGL knowledge.

  <table class="table-fixed">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Feature</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>WebGL Abstraction:</td>
        <td>
          Three.js provides a powerful abstraction over WebGL, making it much
          easier to create and render 3D graphics in the browser without
          directly working with low-level WebGL code. It simplifies tasks like
          creating 3D objects, handling lights, cameras, materials, and
          textures, allowing developers to focus on the creative aspects of 3D
          development rather than dealing with complex WebGL APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this guide, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Threejs and React
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

##### Let’s start by creating a Next.js app.

### 1. Install Next.js: Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

During the setup process, you’ll be asked a few questions like:

- Would you like to use TypeScript?
- Would you like to use ESLint?
- Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?
- Follow the prompts by typing yes or no as shown in the image below:

<img
  src="/images/next-three-start-1.png"
  alt="installation setup reference image"
/>

Simply refer to the image above for guidance on how to answer each question.This process will create a new project

### 2. Start the development server by entering following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If there are no errors, you can enter `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, and you will see the following screen:

<img
  src="/images/next-three-start-2.png"
  alt="installation setup reference image"
/>

## Install Three.js

Now that we have a Next.js project ready, let’s install Three.js to start working with 3D graphics.

### 1. Install Three.js: In your project directory, run:

```bash
npm install --save three
```

This will install Three.js and add it to your project dependencies.

## Creating a simple 3D scene using Three.js

To render a 3D scene in your Next.js app, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Three.js Component

Inside your `src/app/` directory, create a new folder named `components` and add a file with the name `ThreejsScene.tsx`. Use the following tsx code:

```tsx
"use client";

import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import * as THREE from "three";

/**
 * A component that renders a simple Three.js scene
 */
const ThreeScene = () => {
  /**
   * A reference to the canvas element that will be used to render the scene
   */
  const canvasRef = (useRef < HTMLCanvasElement) | (null > null);
  /**
   * A reference to the scene
   */
  const sceneRef = (useRef < THREE.Scene) | (null > null);
  /**
   * A reference to the WebGL renderer
   */
  const rendererRef = (useRef < THREE.WebGLRenderer) | (null > null);
  /**
   * A reference to the camera
   */
  const cameraRef = (useRef < THREE.PerspectiveCamera) | (null > null);

  /**
   * An effect that initializes the scene, camera, and renderer on mount
   * and cleans up on unmount
   */
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!canvasRef.current) {
      console.error("Canvas ref is null");
      return;
    }
    // Initialize scene, camera, and renderer
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    sceneRef.current = scene;

    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
      75,
      window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
      0.1,
      1000
    );
    camera.position.z = 5;
    cameraRef.current = camera;

    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas: canvasRef.current });
    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    rendererRef.current = renderer;

    // Add a simple cube
    const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
    const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    scene.add(cube);

    // Animation loop
    const animate = () => {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
      cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
      cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
      renderer.render(scene, camera);
    };

    animate();

    // Clean up on component unmount
    return () => {
      renderer.dispose();
      scene.clear();
    };
  }, []);

  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} />;
};

export default ThreeScene;
```

### Explanation:

1. References: We use useRef to create references for the canvas, scene, camera, and renderer, allowing us to access and manipulate them throughout the component lifecycle.

2. useEffect Hook: This hook initializes the Three.js scene and handles the animation loop. The cleanup function disposes of the renderer and clears the scene when the component unmounts.

3. Canvas Element: We return a canvas element where the Three.js scene will be rendered.

### 2. Integrate the Three.js Canvas Component:

Next step is to integrate the threejs canvas component in the src/page.tsx .Open src/page.tsx and modify it to include the ThreeScene component:

Open `src/page.tsx` and modify it to include the `ThreejsScene` component:

```tsx
import ThreejsScene from "./components/ThreejsScene";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen">
      <h1 className="mx-auto text-2xl text-center">
        Next js and Three js 3d scene
      </h1>
      <ThreejsScene />
    </div>
  );
}
```

If there are no errors in terminal, you can refresh `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, and you will see the following screen:

<img src="/images/next-three-start-4.gif" alt="3d rendering cube animation" />
