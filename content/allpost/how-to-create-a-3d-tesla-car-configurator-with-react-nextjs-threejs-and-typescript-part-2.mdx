    {
      "question": "What is Three.js, and how does it relate to 3D web development?",
      "answer": "Three.js is a JavaScript library that helps create 3D graphics in web browsers. It makes it easier to render 3D objects, add textures, lighting, and animations. In 3D web development, Three.js is important for making engaging 3D experiences like configurators, games, and interactive visualizations.",
    },
    {
      "question": "Why should I use Next.js for my 3D configurator project?",
      "answer": "Next.js is a framework for React that offers features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and built-in SEO improvements, making it great for 3D configurator projects. Using Next.js helps your 3D configurator load faster and perform better in search engines. Its strong routing and React-based structure also help manage 3D scenes and customization options efficiently.",
    },
    {
      "question": "How can TypeScript enhance my 3D configurator project?",
      "answer": "TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps reduce errors during development and improves code quality. For a 3D configurator project, TypeScript makes it easier to maintain code, offers autocompletion, and provides clearer documentation with defined types. This can greatly improve your development process and make it easier to scale the project.",
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the benefits of using React Three Fiber for 3D development?",
      "answer": "React Three Fiber lets you build 3D experiences in React by handling 3D objects as React components. This works well with React's state management and lifecycle methods. Using React Three Fiber in your 3D projects makes it easier to reuse code, use React hooks, and improve efficiency by organizing 3D objects within the React framework.",
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I customize textures and materials in my 3D configurator?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can fully customize textures and materials in a 3D configurator. By accessing the mesh of your 3D model, you can change material properties and apply custom textures, including images uploaded by users. This flexibility allows for interactive and personalized 3D configurators where users can see their customizations in real time.",

This is my part 2 of my previous post [How to Create a 3D Tesla Car Configurator with React, Next.js, Three.js and TypeScript - Part 1](/blog/nextjs/how-to-create-a-3d-tesla-car-configurator-with-react-nextjs-threejs-and-typescript-part-2).
You can find project file ins the github repository [Click here](https://github.com/rajeshedayangatt/3d-car-configurator)
In this post we will create a interactive ui changing the color of 3d tesla car with Next.js and React Three Fiber.

## Start the server

You can start the server by running the below commands. `i am hoping you have clone the repository project from git`

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you try to load the `http://localhost:3000/` in browser you will see the 3d tesla car configurator (Message me if you found any errors in the terminal while installing or running node packages)

## Adding a color picker panel

We need to add a color picker panel for updating the body part of the Tesla 3D car. There is a package called <a href='https://github.com/pmndrs/leva'><b>Leva</b></a> that easily integrates a GUI into a Next.js application.
If you want more stylized color-picking dashboards, they can be made using Tailwind CSS and React state management libraries. Here, I am just trying to teach you the basics of how everything works so you can build on top of this.

Add this to the `dependencies` in package.json

```json
"leva": "^0.9.35",
```

Add this after to the `devDependencies` in package.json `"There is an error i have faced when using color picker in next.js"`. I have found a solution from here <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/leva/issues/508">Link</a>.

```json
"overrides": {
    "leva": {
        "@radix-ui/react-portal": "1.0.2"
    }
}
```

  alt="3D Tesla car configurator example with React and Next.js Package Json Screenshot"
/>

Run the command in terminal for installing

```bash
npm install
```

Update the `src/app/components/CanvasRender.tsx` component by adding `Leva`

```typescript
"use client";
import React, { Suspense, useEffect } from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import Car from "./Car";
import { Environment, OrbitControls } from "@react-three/drei";
import { Ground } from "./Ground";
import { useControls, Leva } from "leva";

const CanvasRender = (): JSX.Element => {
  const { frontLogoColor } = useControls({ frontLogoColor: "#f00" });
  const { carBodyColor } = useControls({ carBodyColor: "#f00" });

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full">
      <Canvas camera={{ fov: 75, position: [0, 5, 5] }}>
        <ambientLight intensity={1} />
        <OrbitControls
          enableZoom={true}
          enablePan={false}
          minPolarAngle={0}
          maxPolarAngle={Math.PI / 2.25}
          makeDefault
        />
        <Suspense fallback={null}>
          <Environment
            resolution={256}
            background={true}
            blur={10}
            files="piazza_san_marco_1k.hdr"
          ></Environment>
          <Car frontLogoColor={frontLogoColor} carBodyColor={carBodyColor} />
          <Ground />
        </Suspense>
      </Canvas>

      <Leva />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CanvasRender;
```

### Code Explanation

1. First we import `useControls` hook and `Leva` component for implementing the color picker gui

   ```typescript
   import { useControls, Leva } from "leva";
   ```

2. After we use `useControls` hooks set color picker for each body part

   ```typescript
   const { frontLogoColor } = useControls({ frontLogoColor: "#f00" });
   const { carBodyColor } = useControls({ carBodyColor: "#f00" });
   ```

   <blockquote>
     Here we updating only two part of the tesla car configurator model for
     demo. purpose.
   </blockquote>

3. Update `Car` component by passing `useControls` color values as props.

   ```typescript
   <Car frontLogoColor={frontLogoColor} carBodyColor={carBodyColor} />
   ```

4. Add the `<Leva />` component to `CanvasRender`.

   ```typescript
   <Leva />
   ```

## Adding configurator functionality

Update the `src/app/components/Car.tsx`

```typescript
import { useGLTF } from "@react-three/drei";
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { Color } from "three";

const Car = ({ ...props }) => {
  const { scene } = useGLTF("car.glb");
  const carBody = scene.getObjectByName("DoorHandles");
  const carFrontLogo = scene.getObjectByName("FrontLogo");

  useEffect(() => {
    const clr = new Color(props.carBodyColor);
    (carBody as any).material.color = clr;
    (carBody as any).material.needsUpdate = true;
  }, [props.carBodyColor]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const clr = new Color(props.frontLogoColor);
    (carFrontLogo as any).material.color = clr;
    (carFrontLogo as any).material.needsUpdate = true;
  }, [props.frontLogoColor]);
  return (
    <primitive
      scale={1.6}
      rotation={[0, Math.PI / 5, 0]}
      castShadow
      receiveShadow
      object={scene}
    />
  );
};

export default Car;
```

### Code Explanation

import { Color } from "three";

1.  import the `Color` instance from the library for converting to  color code to `three.js` format for error free use.

    ```typescript
    import { Color } from "three";
    ```

    <blockquote>
      Using a THREE.Color instance in Three.js helps keep colors consistent,
      makes it easier to blend or adjust colors, and works well for performance
      in the Three.js system. It supports different color formats like hex, RGB,
      and HSL, and fits nicely with shaders and lighting in 3D scenes
    </blockquote>

2.  Next, we need to use the `getObjectByName` method from the `Three.js` library to retrieve the body parts of the Tesla 3D car configurator model. Please check the image below for different part of the 3d model.

    ```typescript
    const carBody = scene.getObjectByName("DoorHandles");
    const carFrontLogo = scene.getObjectByName("FrontLogo");
    ```

      alt="3D Tesla car configurator example with React and Next.js Car Model Meshes Screenshot"
    />

3.  Finally we use `useEffect` hook from `react.js` to update the color material of the `carBody` and `carFrontLogo` meshes.

    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
      const clr = new Color(props.carBodyColor);
      (carBody as any).material.color = clr;
      (carBody as any).material.needsUpdate = true;
    }, [props.carBodyColor]);
    useEffect(() => {
      const clr = new Color(props.frontLogoColor);
      (carFrontLogo as any).material.color = clr;
      (carFrontLogo as any).material.needsUpdate = true;
    }, [props.frontLogoColor]);
    ```
