```

What is React Three Fiber?

React Three Fiber is a powerful React renderer for Three.js, allowing developers to build 3D experiences
in a more declarative way. It leverages React's component-based architecture to manage
3D objects as React components, making it easier to integrate 3D graphics into your
web applications. With React Three Fiber, you can utilize the full power of Three.js
while benefiting from React's state management and lifecycle methods.

React Three Drei is a library of helpful components and hooks for React Three Fiber that simplifies
common tasks in 3D development, making it easier to create complex scenes with less
boilerplate code.

### Why Use React Three Fiber Instead of Directly Using Three.js?

- Declarative Syntax: React Three Fiber allows you to write your 3D scenes in a declarative manner, similar to how you create UI components in React. This means you can manage 3D objects as React components, simplifying the workflow.

- Component Reusability: With React Three Fiber, you can create reusable 3D components, making it easier to build complex scenes and maintain your codebase.

- Compatibility with React Ecosystem: Since it is built on React, you can use hooks, context, and other React features to enhance your 3D applications.

## Create a Car Component

You can download the 3d car model i have used from the git repository and save it in the public folder of your project (Create a public folder in the next js root directory). You can load the model using the useLoader hook provided by React Three Fiber.

<img
  src="/images/Screenshot 2024-10-01 144856.png"
  alt="3D Tesla car configurator example with React and Next.js Folder Structure Screenshot"
/>

Create Car.tsx file inside `src/app/components` folder and paste the below code

```tsx
import { useGLTF } from "@react-three/drei";
import React from "react";

const Car = () => {
  const { scene } = useGLTF("car.glb");

  return (
    <primitive
      scale={1.6}
      rotation={[0, Math.PI / 5, 0]}
      castShadow
      receiveShadow
      object={scene}
    />
  );
};

export default Car;
```

### Code Explanation: Loading a 3D Car Model with React Three Fiber

In this snippets we are using react three fiber drei <b><a target="_blank" href="https://drei.docs.pmnd.rs/loaders/gltf-use-gltf">useGLTF</a></b> hook to load the 3d model from public folder

- The return statement renders a `<primitive>` component, which is used to represent the loaded 3D object in the scene.
- We set the scale property to 1.6, which adjusts the size of the car model. You can modify this value to make the model larger or smaller as needed.
- The rotation property is an array that specifies the rotation of the model in radians. In this case, it rotates the model around the Y-axis by Math.PI / 5 radians (approximately 36 degrees).
- The castShadow and receiveShadow props enable shadow casting and receiving, respectively, enhancing the visual realism of the scene.

## Create a Ground Component

Create Ground.tsx file inside `src/app/components` folder and paste the below code. You need to download ground texture maps from the repository and place it in the `public/texture` folder

```tsx
import { TextureLoader } from "three";
import { useLoader } from "@react-three/fiber";

export function Ground() {
  const [colorMap, displacementMap, normalMap, roughnessMap, aoMap] = useLoader(
    TextureLoader,
    [
      "texture/Concrete_Blocks_012_basecolor.jpg",
      "texture/Concrete_Blocks_012_height.png",
      "texture/Concrete_Blocks_012_normal.jpg",
      "texture/Concrete_Blocks_012_roughness.jpg",
      "texture/Concrete_Blocks_012_ambientOcclusion.jpg",
    ]
  );

  return (
    <mesh
      position={[0, 0.4, 0]}
      rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}
      scale={[1, 1, 1]}
      receiveShadow={true}
    >
      <planeGeometry args={[50, 50, 100, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial
        side={2}
        map={colorMap}
        displacementMap={displacementMap}
        normalMap={normalMap}
        roughnessMap={roughnessMap}
        aoMap={aoMap}
      />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

### Code Explanation: Creating a ground component for placing car model for realistic feel

- We are using `useLoader` hook `"@react-three/fiber"` for loading the texture maps for the plane mesh ground.
  The useLoader hook is used to load multiple textures at once. It takes TextureLoader as the first argument and an array of texture file paths as the second argument.
- Each texture serves a different purpose:

  - colorMap: The base color of the ground.
  - displacementMap: Used to create height variations on the surface.
  - normalMap: Provides surface details and enhances the appearance of depth.
  - roughnessMap: Determines the surface's roughness, affecting how light interacts with it.
  - aoMap: Ambient occlusion map, which adds shading to crevices and enhances realism.

  if you wanted to learn more about the texture maps there is youtube video i found useful

    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>

- Finally we create 3d mesh using `"@react-three/fiber"` mesh , planeGeometry and meshStandardMaterial default components.

  This Ground component creates a textured ground plane in the 3D scene using
  multiple texture maps for a more realistic appearance. By leveraging the power
  of React Three Fiber and Three.js, you can easily add detailed environments to
  your 3D applications.

## Build a CanvasRender Component

Create CanvasRender.tsx file inside `src/app/components` folder and paste the below code.Add the Ground and Car component to the CanvasRender component.

```tsx
"use client";
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import Car from "./Car";
import { Environment, OrbitControls } from "@react-three/drei";
import { Ground } from "./Ground";

const CanvasRender = (): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full">
      <Canvas camera={{ fov: 75, position: [0, 5, 5] }}>
        <ambientLight intensity={1} />
        <OrbitControls
          enableZoom={true}
          enablePan={false}
          minPolarAngle={0}
          maxPolarAngle={Math.PI / 2.25}
          makeDefault
        />
        <Suspense fallback={null}>
          <Environment
            resolution={256}
            background={true}
            blur={10}
            files="piazza_san_marco_1k.hdr"
          ></Environment>
          <Car />
          <Ground />
        </Suspense>
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CanvasRender;
```

### Code Explanation: Rendering a 3D Car Scene with Ground and Environment

- We are adding previously created `<Car />` and `<Ground />` component into `"@react-three/fiber"` `<Canvas>`.
  We define a camera with a field of view (fov) of 75 degrees and position it at [0, 5, 5] to view the scene from above and at an angle.
  You can adjust the position and fov for better view.
- The `<ambientLight />` provides a soft light that uniformly illuminates the entire scene, ensuring that no parts of the model appear too dark.
- The `<OrbitControls />` allows the user to interact with the camera by rotating and zooming in on the model.
  We’ve configured it to enable zoom but restrict panning, ensuring the user remains focused on the model.
  The minPolarAngle and maxPolarAngle ensure that the user can only rotate the view between certain vertical angles.
- `<Environment />` component from `@react-three/drei` simulates realistic lighting by providing an HDR (high dynamic range) image as the lighting source.
  This enhances the look of the 3D model by reflecting the environment around it.
  Using an environment map can be less computationally expensive compared to multiple light sources, especially when trying to achieve complex reflections or global illumination effects.
  This can improve performance in web applications.

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>

- Since the textures and models are loaded asynchronously, it’s essential to use react `Suspense` component to manage the loading state.

## Adding the CanvasRender Component

Add CanvasRender.tsx file to `src/app/page.tsx`

```tsx
import CanvasRender from "./components/CanvasRender";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <CanvasRender />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Finally we add CanvasRender `component` to `page` render 3d car environment in next js.

Start the development server by entering following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If there are no errors, you can enter `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser, and you will see the following screen:
